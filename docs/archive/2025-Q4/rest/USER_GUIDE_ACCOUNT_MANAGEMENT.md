**No.** Once deleted, it's gone forever. That's why we strongly recommend downloading your data first!

**You can't undo it.** You'll need to create a new account. If you downloaded your data first, you can manually re-enter it with the new account.

### "Will deleting my data delete my account?"
**No.** Deleting your data removes all your entries, but your account stays active. You can log in and start fresh.
