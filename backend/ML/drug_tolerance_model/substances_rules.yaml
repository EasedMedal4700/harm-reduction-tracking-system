version: 1.0.0
purpose: Control how strongly ML output is anchored to inspo priors

inspo_anchor:
  weight: 2.0
  description: >
    Controls how strongly inspo.json influences ML-derived values.
    Higher values force ML output to stay closer to inspo priors.
    Lower values allow greater ML-driven differentiation.

constraints:
  weight:
    min: 0.5
    max: 2.0

defaults:
  interpretation:
    0.5: "ML-dominant (high freedom)"
    1.0: "Balanced (default)"
    1.1: "Light inspo bias"
    1.2: "Moderate inspo bias"
    1.3: "Strong inspo bias"
    1.5: "Very strong inspo bias"
    2.0: "Inspo nearly authoritative"
