version: 1.0.0
purpose: Control how strongly ML output is anchored to inspo priors

inspo_anchor:
  weight: 1.0
  description: >
    Controls how strongly inspo.json influences ML-derived values.
    A value of 1.0 represents a neutral balance between inspo priors
    and ML inference.
    Values above 1.0 increasingly constrain ML output toward inspo.json.
    Values below 1.0 allow ML to diverge more freely from inspo priors.

constraints:
  weight:
    min: 0.5
    max: 2.0
  behavior:
    - anchor_scales_all_neuro_bucket_weights: true
    - anchor_scales_tolerance_parameters: true
    - anchor_does_not_create_new_buckets: true
    - anchor_cannot_override_hard_pharmacology_rules: true

defaults:
  interpretation:
    0.5: "ML-dominant (high freedom, exploratory)"
    1.0: "Balanced (default, recommended)"
    1.1: "Light inspo bias (minor stabilization)"
    1.2: "Moderate inspo bias (preferred for known substances)"
    1.3: "Strong inspo bias (limits speculative drift)"
    1.5: "Very strong inspo bias (near-prior locking)"
    2.0: "Inspo nearly authoritative (manual override mode)"

notes:
  - inspo_anchor affects relative weighting, not absolute truth
  - inspo_anchor should be increased for well-characterized substances
  - inspo_anchor should be decreased for novel or poorly studied compounds
  - inspo_anchor must not be used to justify unsupported neuro buckets
