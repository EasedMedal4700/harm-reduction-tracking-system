  "Main article: Subjective effect index It is important to know in advance the duration, subjective effects and potential adverse effects which the substance or combination of substances are likely to produce. There are many online resources to use for education and reference regarding this aspect of substance usage, such as the psychoactive substance index. For further research on the effects of any substance that one may be considering, a combination of Erowid, Tripsit, Wikipedia, and Google can be used. It may also help to read relevant anecdotal trip reports found here on PsychonautWiki or elsewhere on the internet. Additionally, discussion forums like bluelight often have useful information, particularly for novel psychoactive substances, although users should read the posts there critically. If the user knows the exact effects of the substance in advance, then they will know what to expect. This is something that significantly reduces the chances of a negative experience by a huge margin through the prevention of unexpected circumstances."
